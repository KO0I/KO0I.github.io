      <h1>Welcome to my personal webpage</h1> 
      <br>My name is Pat<br>
      <p>I like to make stuff.
         </p> 
      <p>I am an electrical engineer working on digital design verification at <a
        href="https://texasinstruments.com/">Texas Instruments.</a> 
        I have a B.S. from the <a href="https://ecee.colorado.edu/">University of Colorado Boulder</a> 
      <p>I am interested in amateur radio, particularly in homebrewing
      equipment. I hold an Extra License with the
      callsign KO0I, but I've only recently found the space to build my HF
      antenna. I have been
      playing with RepRap machines for many years and presently own my best
      approximation of a Prusa i3, I use it to print all kinds of things. I
      enjoy gardening, zero-waste, being outdoors, and bicycling.
         </p>
      <p> I will also be linking up my DIY weather station and some other things I
      find interesting. Links will be broken initially.</p>
