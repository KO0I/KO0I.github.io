&lt;p&gt;Last month I began and failed to post about a prior school project’s
documentation before starting an independent study. Work continued to escalate,as I am working in a design role, and I am new to most of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s exciting but also challenging me to try to think about a block and answer
questions and come up with bug-fixes under pressure. In the years of prior work, I have been doing digital design where I’m trying to find bugs before there’s a lot of pressure on the designer(s) and cost to deploy the bug-fixes. In many ways it’s the opposite set of pressures and I’m still trying to adapt to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of what feels acutely overwhelming are the number of interactions I have
to keep track of, and the importance of defining simple, intelligible
boundaries between blocks so jobs are clear-cut and new features don’t require
modifying a zillion blocks. I am reminded of the concept taught in PES: to have
low coupling and high cohesion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now with a summer independent study deep underway in a state of disorganization, I have been struggling to get momentum due to a few nuisansome issues with tooling and, honestly,
perfectionism. Work has also demanded a lot of time, and frankly there is
disorganization there as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This blog post is to sort of consider the various tools for taking notes and consider what seems to work, how things have been used, and maybe how to pull things all together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes-consolidation&quot;&gt;Notes Consolidation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an even on my Outlook calendar at work. The idea is that every week I
pull together the prior week’s work, and try to prepare for the next week
ahead. The goal is to think about to set my next work morning up for a quick
settle in by: (1) gathering up a summary of where I was so I don’t have to
review too many notes, (2) reminding me of things that I was debugging, (3) give me confidence that what I’m workig on is the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As time has gone on I have not maintained this practice and it is time to
revive it. I can’t keep everything in my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So what would notes consolidation look like? Where am I keeping my notes? What
tools have I used in the past, which do I like, and which will I use in the
future as I do “notes consolidation?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let’s begin with the must-haves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;college-note-taking&quot;&gt;College Note-Taking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;College lectures are intense and unless the professor is bungling hard, the
lectures are jam-packed with essential information. Taking notes in a college
class is an art unto itself that I mastered, but it’s also not too hard
considering how organized most of these presentations are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the hundreds of times that a certain required course, some
long-bemoanded pre-req that has been taught regularly. Think about how standardized elements of the course must be. How many times it’s been organized again and again. So to take notes during such a lecture means that the material isn’t likely to be full of digressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Gradaute school is an interesting environment where a lot more organization
work is put on the student. Either as a part of their work as TA’s or in
working on their projects. The more advanced the study, the less guidance
there is. There will not be a simple set of YouTube tutorial videos covering breaking topics. Self-directed learning at a high-school level is not so bad on account of the sheer abundance of information there is for that level of education. There’s plenty for undergrad, but as topics get more advanced, the paywalls appear and more and more is bound up in papers rather than snappy videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So more than ever, self-directed note taking and gathering has taken on an
importance not only to get information about a subject from interactions with
professors, etc. but also work out schedule, expectations, and other
project-management items. In undergrad the goalposts were fixed but in grad
school there is room for discussion. It is more important than ever to both
advocate for oneself but also to be organized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;too-many-notes&quot;&gt;Too Many Notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At work, every word from my boss is not from on high. I often focus on some
detail and he goes on, and I lose track. It breaks the rhythm worse if I don’t
ask for a pause, and it would be bad to constantly halt conversation to slowly
soak in implications or catch that interesting edge case or questionable thing
quickly.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Gathering Thoughts</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Some Thoughts on Documentation</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/07/26/NotesConsolidation.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Some Thoughts on Documentation" /><published>2020-07-26T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-07-26T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2020/07/26/NotesConsolidation</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2020/07/26/NotesConsolidation.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;gathering-thoughts&quot;&gt;Gathering Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I do creative work, I need to keep track of a lot of things: I need
to track what I’ve been told, I need to remember questions I want to ask
and ask before I are forced to make assumptions, I need to know where
I’m at, what the end looks like, and what being stuck or moving looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Last month I began and failed to post about a prior school project’s
documentation before starting an independent study. Work continued to escalate,as I am working in a design role, and I am new to most of it. So I’m not seeing a pattern of struggling to get momentum on things, and worse, it’s hard to pick back up or determine what I did later on. No, a cool video demonstrating the working project doesn’t help enough…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Both graduate school and my new work roles have pushed me to re-evaluate the
tools that I use to manage my time and the information I’m trying to wrangle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The set of skills I’m struggling to develop further
involves: documentation, planning, and I’d guess I’d call it project
awareness or maybe proprioception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s exciting but also challenging me to try to think about a block and answer
questions and come up with bug-fixes under pressure. In the years of prior work, I have been doing digital design where I’m trying to find bugs before there’s a lot of pressure on the designer(s) and cost to deploy the bug-fixes. In many ways it’s the opposite set of pressures and I’m still trying to adapt to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goal-a-system&quot;&gt;Goal: A system&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of all this is to try and work out a consistent system to use to
gather thoughts, process notes, distill things down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;notes-consolidation&quot;&gt;Notes Consolidation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an even on my Outlook calendar at work. The idea is that every week I
pull together the prior week’s work, and try to prepare for the next week
ahead. The goal is to think about to set my next work morning up for a quick

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So what would notes consolidation look like? Where am I keeping my notes? What
tools have I used in the past, which do I like, and which will I use in the
future as I do “notes consolidation?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let’s begin with the must-haves of such a “system”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Must be usable for either school or work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Must allow me to use copious amounts of paper if needed, but not
necessarily of the nice notebook&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Must eventually be searchable in some way&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Should incorporate automatic accountability (recording when something was
complete)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Must not take ages and ages to accumulate and compile, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Must be associated with my devices so I’m bothered with a banner and a
buzz to tell me to get to x, y, or z. It works for appointments, so use
them for breaking things up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Must be sharable in some way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Tools that I have used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Overleaf&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Github&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dropbox&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Outlook/Gmail
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;email&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;calendar&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;both offer task stuff… but they are exclusive to each other still&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Google Docs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confluence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;suckless dmenu adapted to be a todo list (on
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/KO0I/scripts/blob/master/todo&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;)
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I really like this option because I can add a time when a task was
added, and mark the time it was completed in the completed file, thereby
measuring how long tasks took.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paper: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poketo.com/collections/planners/products/concept-planner-plum&quot;&gt;Poketo Concept Planner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some notebook for class/hobby/project thoughts. Graph or dot ruled usually&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Tools for sharing I could use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This website?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OneNote (ew microsoft)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;college-note-taking&quot;&gt;College Note-Taking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;College lectures are dense, unless the professor is bungling hard. So the
lectures are jam-packed with essential information. Taking notes in a college
class is an art unto itself that I mastered, but it’s also not too hard
considering how organized most of these presentations are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This github pages and jekyll business is quite slick so far! I have held onto
this cute domain name for a few years and just could not get started on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My partner helpfully suggested that I go with a blog style, which is probably
a little more organic and suitable for my whole way of doing things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some ideas that I want to play with on this humble site of mine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hobbyist tech projects
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Ham radio and wireless
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Antenna Modeling and Design&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Radio Astronomy&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Homebrew equiprment&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Not contesting. Blegh!&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Automation and robotics
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;RepRap&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Gardening&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Verilog&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Embedded C&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;DSP&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Open-Source software&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Electromagnetics Simulation&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Weather&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Music
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Sampling&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Processing Effects&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Digital Synthesis&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Documentation for troubleshooting, prior projects&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interactive data plots
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Maybe integrate fun things such as: &lt;a href=&quot;https://mvdwoord.github.io/tools/2017/02/04/Notebook_in_gist_in_jekyll.html&quot;&gt;Jupyter Notebooks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talk about habits, er… lifehacks
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Documentation has been on my mind a lot lately…&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Omotenashi&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Organizing Thoughts and Planning&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pictures of cool places&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Links to useful resources&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rabbit holes of various sorts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it seems that I have many directions I want to take this, and many of them
are open-ended. I suppose if you know me at all, you can expect it to be scattered.&lt;br /&gt;
My hope is to get into making some kind of little post every now and again on something that I found interesting or useful.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I have reached the “build your own website” stage of COVID-19 quarantine</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A test</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/none/2020/06/27/firstPost.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A test" /><published>2020-06-27T13:39:23-06:00</published><updated>2020-06-27T13:39:23-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/none/2020/06/27/firstPost</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/none/2020/06/27/firstPost.html">&lt;p&gt;Just saying hello&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Just saying hello</summary></entry></feed>
