I"<p>Hi! Iâ€™m Amber!<br /></p>

<p>I am interested in amateur radio, particularly in homebrewing
      equipment. I hold an Extra License with the
      callsign KO0I, but Iâ€™ve only recently found the space to build my HF
      antenna. I have been
      playing with RepRap machines for many years (since 2010) and presently own my best
      approximation of a Prusa i3, I use it to print all kinds of things. I
      enjoy gardening, zero-waste, tinkering, trading, being outdoors, and bicycling.</p>
