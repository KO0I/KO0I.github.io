<p>This github pages and jekyll business is quite slick so far! I have held onto
this cute domain name for a few years and just could not get started on it.</p>

<p>My partner helpfully suggested that I go with a blog style, which is probably
a little more organic and suitable for my whole way of doing things.</p>

<p>Some ideas that I want to play with on this humble site of mine:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hobbyist tech projects
    <ul>
      <li>Ham radio and wireless
        <ul>
          <li>Antenna Modeling and Design</li>
          <li>Radio Astronomy</li>
          <li>Homebrew equiprment</li>
          <li>Not contesting. Blegh!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Automation and robotics
        <ul>
          <li>RepRap</li>
          <li>Gardening</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Verilog</li>
      <li>Embedded C</li>
      <li>DSP</li>
      <li>Open-Source software</li>
      <li>Electromagnetics Simulation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Weather</li>
  <li>Music
    <ul>
      <li>Sampling</li>
      <li>Processing Effects</li>
      <li>Digital Synthesis</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Documentation for troubleshooting, prior projects</li>
  <li>Interactive data plots
    <ul>
      <li>Maybe integrate fun things such as: <a href="https://mvdwoord.github.io/tools/2017/02/04/Notebook_in_gist_in_jekyll.html">Jupyter Notebooks</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Talk about habits, er‚Ä¶ lifehacks
    <ul>
      <li>Documentation has been on my mind a lot lately‚Ä¶</li>
      <li>Omotenashi</li>
      <li>Organizing Thoughts and Planning</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Pictures of cool places</li>
  <li>Links to useful resources</li>
  <li>Rabbit holes of various sorts</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
<br /></p>

<p>So, it seems that I have many directions I want to take this, and many of them
are open-ended. I suppose if you know me at all, you can expect it to be scattered.<br />
My hope is to get into making some kind of little post every now and again on something that I found interesting or useful.</p>
