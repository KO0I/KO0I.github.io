I"ñ<h1 id="why">Why?</h1>

<p>I‚Äôm getting tired of streaming services when I have media on my machine that
I‚Äôd like to stream. Having things gathered up allows for a more reliable
source for the media. I also wanted to have a uniform experience across
devices accessing my own personal media library.</p>

<p>Finally, I wanted the option to extend access to my media library in the
future in a way that is at once secure but also not overly cumbersome for
friends trying to just watch a movie or whatever. This external access is an aspirational goal
for the future.</p>

<h2 id="problems-with-the-old-way-vlc">Problems with the old way: VLC</h2>

<p>Previously I would use VLC to stream video to other devices. 
VLC can supposedly stream to Chromecasts via choosing it as the Renderer
output in VLC. However, there are specific codec requirements for the
Chromecast and there‚Äôs the option to use something like
<a href="github.com/petrkotek/chromecastize">Chromecastize</a> to attempt to convert the
library in advance to stream more quickly. Streaming on the go can be
time-intensive and who wants to bother looking up ffmpeg errors when the
script invariably encounters some media that requires intervention to continue
conversion.</p>

<h1 id="the-alternative-jellyfin">The Alternative: Jellyfin</h1>

<p><a href="www.jellyfin.org">Jellyfin</a> is an open-source way to access media on a
network. It‚Äôs a service that basically does the same thing that Plex does
without the extras.</p>

<p>There are ways to get it to work over the internet, but
this is not interesting to me. This post is intended to briefly address the
little troubles I ran into along the way getting this program working on a
LAN.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>I won‚Äôt bore you with installation details, apart to say that allowing network access
is important. I‚Äôm new to Jellyfin, so it also took me a slightly embarassing
amount of time to realize that network settings aren‚Äôt under settings per se
but under ‚ÄúDashboard‚Äù.</p>

<p>I also wanted to say that this service does not require your router to be set
up in UPNP (Universal Plug and Play), which is good! I had put off exploring
this for some time because I was under the impression that the router had to
be in some configuration I consider undesirable. This is not the case! Yay!</p>

<h2 id="network-configuration">Network Configuration</h2>

<p>I had to make sure my windows machine (the media server running Jellyfin) believed the network was a Private network. I had previously set it to public. Oops!</p>

<p>Similarly, on Linux, any firewall settings had to allow for connections over
the port chosen for the Jellyfin connection.</p>

<p>On the server side, filtering can be enabled. I think this it could be a good
idea to whitelist a number of known ‚Äúsafe‚Äù devices, especially if I ever do
decide to open things up to the wider internet.</p>

<h2 id="quirks-on-iphone">Quirks on iPhone</h2>

<p>Android is well-supported but iPhone appears to not be able to cast to the
Chromecast when it is running Jellyfin as a connected device.</p>

<p>This barely matters as the Android Jellyfin app is able to connect to the
Jellyfin server and one only has to use the Chromecast remote for media
control.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>After working out quirks, the system is quite nice for accessing my personal
library without having to use an ineffecient option like copying the files
over (i.e. Dropbox or external drives) or using software which can feel
inconsistent (VLC, ffmpeg, and all the rest of the myriad details of video encoding/conversion).</p>

<p>I am hosting a movie night tonight and we shall see how smoothly the user
experience is then.</p>
