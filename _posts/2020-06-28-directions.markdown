# I have reached the "build your own website" stage of COVID-19 quarantine

This github pages and jekyll business is quite slick so far! I have held onto
this cute domain name for a few years and just could not get started on it.

My partner helpfully suggested that I go with a blog style, which is probably
a little more organic and suitable for my whole way of doing things.

Some ideas that I want to play with on this humble site of mine:

* Hobbyist tech projects
  * Ham radio and wireless
    * Antenna Modeling and Design
    * Radio Astronomy
    * Homebrew equiprment
    * Not contesting. Blegh!
  * Automation and robotics
    * RepRap
    * Gardening
  * Verilog
  * Embedded C
  * DSP
  * Open-Source software
  * Electromagnetics Simulation
* Weather
* Music
  * Sampling
  * Processing Effects
  * Digital Synthesis
* Documentation for troubleshooting, prior projects
* Interactive data plots
  * Maybe integrate fun things such as: [Jupyter Notebooks](https://mvdwoord.github.io/tools/2017/02/04/Notebook_in_gist_in_jekyll.html)
* Talk about habits, er... lifehacks
  * Documentation has been on my mind a lot lately...
  * Omotenashi
  * Organizing Thoughts and Planning
* Pictures of cool places
* Links to useful resources
* Rabbit holes of various sorts
<br>
<br>
So, it seems that I have many directions I want to take this, and many of them
are open-ended. I suppose if you know me at all, you can expect it to be scattered.<br>
My hope is to get into making some kind of little post every now and again on something that I found interesting or useful.
