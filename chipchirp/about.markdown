Hi! I'm Pat.<br>

I am interested in amateur radio, particularly in homebrewing
      equipment. I hold an Extra License with the
      callsign KO0I, but I've only recently found the space to build my HF
      antenna. I have been
      playing with RepRap machines for many years and presently own my best
      approximation of a Prusa i3, I use it to print all kinds of things. I
      enjoy gardening, zero-waste, being outdoors, and bicycling.
